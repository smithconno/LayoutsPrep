<h1> Layouts Prep</h1>
<p>
The types of d3 layouts are a chord, cluster, force, pack, partition, pie, stack, tree, and treemap. The purpose of a pie layout is to take your data and calculate all the messy angles for you which spares you from having to think about radians. Stack layout generates stacked bar graphs , stacked area charts, and streamgraphs. A force layout consists of nodes and edges, typically circles and lines which generates a pretty layout. 
</p>
<p>
For all of these layouts you use d3. and then which ever layout you want to use. For example, if you wanted to use a chord layout you would do d3.chord. Then, you just follow the d3 algorithm for all of them and you can give attributes to each layout as needed.
